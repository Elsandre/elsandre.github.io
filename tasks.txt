Build the Contact Page
The contact page includes your email address, as well as any other relevant information such as your LinkedIn profile or a personal photo.

Style the content
Now that you have your content, consider how you would like it to look. Do you want to arrange your projects in a grid? In an asymmetrical arrangement? What colors do you want to use to personalize the page?

Make it interactive
Use JavaScript to add interactivity to your website.

Make it responsive
Use responsive design to ensure that your page is viewable on multiple devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).

Publish to the web
Take what you’ve built and use GitHub pages to share with the world.

Next Steps
Congratulations on building your own portfolio! You’re welcome to expand your portfolio beyond these two pages. For example, you can include a page for each project that you’ve built.
